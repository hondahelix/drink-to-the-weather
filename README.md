## Features 


### __1.An area to input your city or your mood __

Our input card functions much like a bartender would. It asks you how you feel, where you from and will use a bouncer(js) if it has to. In order to avoid the bouncer.js you need to enter in at least 3 characters or it will alert you in red below the input field.  

### __2. An area for the drink, ingredients and instructions__

We wanted to create a responsive tablet that gives you everything you need to make a drink.
 
### __3. Other possible reccomendations area__

Just like at a bar, you may decide the first drink you see doesn't sound to good. Don't like pineapple or have milk in your fridge to make the first drink? No problem, just like an experienced bar tender, we got this. We have 4 more drinks you could make that will match your mood perfectly. 

### __4. Other__

 __For later builds__

_Add an api that shows you where you can buy ingredients for the items_

We understand many users may not have a full bar at their homes to make every drink, so we would like to help them seek out the ingredients to help them make the perfect cocktail.

_Include an Api that automatically uses your ip address to search your city_

Who was time to search? With that busy go-go quarentine lifestyle, I no longer have the time or energy to actually type in the name of my city. I want my website to do the work for me. It might be best to have the user be able to correct any errors that the automatic system makes or add additional cities but where we can remove work and add fun we should. 

_The ability to toggle what you want to see_

I have never cared too much about windspeed but I desperately want to know what places feel like- if only there was some way to replace the windspeed with temperature feel and then have the computer save my settings so I don't have to go back every time. I don't exactly know what this would look like but I think it would really improve the usability of this product. 


## Usage
### This is meant for either the seasoned cocktail drinker to get that bar experience at home or the newbie looking to expand their repetoir.
